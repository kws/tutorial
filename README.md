Spring and related tools tutorial
==================================

This project contains some really simple examples to show some of the features of Spring MVC.

The structure is somewhat linear - so example 02 may build on 01 for example, but this may not
always be the case.

# Spring MVC 01

The first sample shows about as basic a setup as is possible. A maven project with embedded jetty
running a single Spring Dispatcher servlet with a single controller.
