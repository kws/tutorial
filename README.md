Spring and related tools tutorial
==================================

This project contains some really simple examples to show some of the features of Spring MVC.

The structure is somewhat linear - so example 02 may build on 01 for example, but this may not
always be the case.

# Spring MVC 01

The first sample shows about as basic a setup as is possible. A maven project with embedded jetty
running a single Spring Dispatcher servlet with a single controller.

[Spring MVC 01](spring-mvc-01/README.md)

# Spring MVC 02

We now add a JSP view to the sample and see how the controller hands over to the view.

# Spring MVC 03

Making the controller work for us.

# Spring MVC 04

Passing parameters to the controller
